          originally only used Discord for gaming and connecting with friends.

          2020, where he also serves as a Teacher and has been prepared to be
          ordained in the Youth Ministry in the following months. He's currently
          studying his Bible and Theology Diploma at The Master's Academy
          International. He's not that much into videogames, he likes reading
          and chess. Three years ago, he joined "Luz Admirable", a
          Spanish-speaking youth ministry in Mexico City where he started
          teaching and preaching more often. In mid 2020, he and his friends
          decided to found "Teología para Todos" (Theology for Everyone), a
          youth christian coalition focused on teaching the Gospel of Christ,
          full display to all peoples from every generation and cultural
          background. Poncho lives in Mexico City, and his main hobby is to be

          working as an independent contractor, and he has so far spent one year
          at the Full Time Training in London - a seminary of sorts - and he is
          planning on going back as soon as possible. He has served with youth
          often, even during his high school years, and continues to do so now.
          He loves God's Word, and the depths and riches that can be found
          therein. That's why He has started doing online Bible studies - so
          that what He has learned about the Bible can be passed on to others,
